The first Souvla opened its doors in April 2014 in the heart of Hayes Valley, and quickly developed a cult-like following for its sandwiches, salads, Greek fries, and frozen Greek yogurt. Soon after, Souvla found its way onto local “best-of” lists and national publications like The New York Times and Bon Appétit magazine. Souvla’s modern approach to the gyro sandwich has been featured on The Today Show and was named the #1 Food Trend of 2015 by Bon Appétit magazine.',
